              The Mass Effect Checklist is a service I created to make it easier
              for me to remember what I needed to do in each game, for a perfect
              ending every time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The checklist items I have curated for each game are selected to
              reveal the most lore, lead to a perfect ending for each game, and
              set you up for the next game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this website was created well after Andromeda was
              released, but I'm not confident I know how the game works so I
              won't be adding it to this list any time
              soon. I'm not even sure the game isn't linear.
